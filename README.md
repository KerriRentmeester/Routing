# **Project Name**:  

Routing

# **Description**: 

The Routing project uses code to demonstrate same page routing (w/o needing to reload the page from the server, which increases the speed/user experience) and routing among pages so that all the pages load once from the server and then stay in the DOM's memory so each subsequent call does not require re-communicating with the server, which increases the speed/user experience. Pay special attention to how the routing was coded in the index.html file. It also employs a semi-functional navbar.

The Routing project is an example of my Javascript, HTML5, and css coding capabilities, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of similar activities I worked on in August of 2023 in module 17 of the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Installation and Usage**: 

To run the project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. You will need a server to see your work. So, for example in VSCode (an editor), open the project directory, open the index.html file, and click on LiveServer. 


# **Dependencies**: 

The project relies on the following dependencies: Bootstrap

# **Roadmap**: 

Future fixes or improvements that would be helpful to a user:

* Adapting the NavBar:

* eliminate the links at the top of the page, and place them in the navbar
* adjust any remaining navbar tabs
* once the entire navbar is fully functional, remove the "disabled" label.
* add a register and log in tabs to navbar & link to home & (create another page for registering)
